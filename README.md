# Root-Force
OPEnS Lab repository dedicated to documentation and code for a scalable force sensor and all code related to Loom use for research in Arkansas.

# Organization
Separate branches in this repository should be made for the RootForce-Sensor, Loom-peripherals, First-Deployment, Hardware, and UARK-Instance-of-Loom.  

These are to keep code that is done on different areas of the project separate and organized.  If you feel that the repo should be reorganized, notify the group in Basecamp of formatting changes you intend to make so that everyone is on the same page.  

# RootForce-Sensor 
Any Arduino code used in programming, calibrating, and logging RootForce Scalable Sensors.  

# Loom-Peripherals
Place Loom code adapted for Decagon soil moisture, Light/Pressure Sensor, and Acceleromter nodes.  This is for the UArk students to keep an updated copy of working code for each node, and to document problems or out of date code when requesting support from the OSU Loom Team.  

# First-Deployment
This repo should store any code used to program microcontrollers/calibrate/etc. during the first deployment.  Students in Arkansas can place code that they used on sensors here for others to reference.  

# Hardware
This is for the PCB BOM, Updated PCB schematics/gerbers, and other notes

# UARK-Instance-of-Loom
This repo should store the end result of the Loom peripherals branch and any added Loom Code settings for the RootForce Sensor (which outputs a generic analog signal in a way similar to decagon soil moisture sensors).  This repo should be created after at least one field test in AK, as an example of all working code in a proof-of-concept design.
